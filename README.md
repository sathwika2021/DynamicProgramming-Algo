# RNA

This project is about finding the pairs in an RNA sequence, implementing the Nussinov algorithm with the idea of dynamic programming. 

First I used DP to calculate the number of most possible pairs, and then traced back to locate the pairs.

There are two ways to test. The switch is in the code.

Alogorithm is optimized, which works well dealing with large number of test cases.
